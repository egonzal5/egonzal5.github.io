	<p>
		This is the first programming course for Computer Science majors
		with a focus on object-oriented programming. The goal of the course
		is to develop skills such as program design and testing as well as
		the implementation of programs using a graphical IDE. All programming
		will be done in Java.

	<div class="h4 myUnderline">Grading Concerns</div>
	<p>
		<strong>It is your responsibility to submit regrade requests by a
			specified deadline; no regrade requests will be processed afterwards.
			Deadlines to address any grading concerns will be available
			at <a href="gradingConcerns.shtml">Grading Concerns</a>.
		</strong>
	</p>

	<div class="h4 myUnderline">Assignments</div>
	<ul>

		<li><strong>Deadlines</strong> -
			All assignments are due at <strong>11:55 pm</strong> and you have until
			<strong>11:55 pm</strong> of the next day to submit your work with
			a <strong>12%</strong> penalty. You will not receive any credit for
			a submission after the late date, except the Good Faith Attempt credit
			(additional information below).
		</li>

		<li><strong>Submit Server</strong> -
			You need to use the
			<a href="https://submit.cs.umd.edu/fall2021">submit server</a> to submit
			you work. We will not accept work submitted otherwise (e.g.,
			email, etc.). <strong>You need to make sure that your assignment solution works
				in the submit server, otherwise you may lose most of the credit.</strong>
		</li>

		<li><strong>Which Assignments Gets Graded</strong> -
			For programming assignments the one with public/release/secret tests
			that scores the highest in the submit server after a late penalty (if any) has been applied.
			We only use public/release/secret tests scores to select the
			submission to grade. Other assignment requirements (e.g., style, methods you
			must implement, allowed classes, etc.) are not considered. We will evaluate
			those requirements on the selected submission.
		</li>

		<li><strong>Good Faith Attempt (GFA)</strong> -
			<strong>You must satisfy a minimum set of requirements (Good Faith Attempt (GFA)) for most class work (usually programming assignments), otherwise you will fail the course (automatic
				grade of F)</strong>. The Good Faith Attempt guarantees you have the skills necessary
			for upper-level courses. A good faith attempt for an assignment is worth 0.5 of your
			class grade. <strong>GFAs are not due at the end of the semester (a common misunderstanding).</strong> GFAs requirements and deadline are available at
			at <a href="goodFaithAttempt.shtml">CMSC131 GFAs</a>. Additional information about good faith attempts is available
			at <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nelson/classes/resources/good_faith_attempt/">GFA Information</a>.
		</li>

		<li><strong>Closed Assignments</strong> -
			<strong>All programming assignments in this course are
				to be written individually (unless explicitly
				indicated otherwise).
			</strong>
		</li>

		<li><strong>No Pop Quizzes/Pop Lab Work</strong> -
			There are no pop quizzes nor pop lab exercises. We will announce in advance (at least one day) if there is any work you need to submit for a grade.
		</li>
	</ul>


	<div class="h4 myUnderline">Regarding Posting of Assignments' Solutions/Implementations</div>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>
				Posting of any assignment solution (even after the course is over)
				in a publicly available online location (e.g., github, Chegg) is prohibited under
				the Code of Academic Integrity (facilitation of academic dishonesty). Any
				student responsible for publicly posting assignments' solutions will be reported
				to the Office of Student Conduct and risks the sanction of an "XF" in the course.
			</strong>
		</li>

		<li>
			Posting of your assignments in a private repository where only selected
			people (e.g., potential employers) have access is OK.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="h4 myUnderline">Covid Related</div>
	<ul>
		<li>
		The campus facilities division have put QR codes on desks throughout the campus.
		A student can scan the QR code where they are sitting each class, which will "register"
		their place and location at a particular time. Additional information at <a href="https://provost.umd.edu/node/4243">https://provost.umd.edu/node/4243 (Q&A 4)</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="h4 myUnderline">TA Room/Office Hours</div>
	<p>
		Office hours get extremely busy the day before an assignment deadline and getting help
		is not guaranteed. Please start your assignments early so you can address any problems
		during office hours.
	</p>

	<div class="h4 myUnderline">Backups</div>
	<p>
		You are responsible for creating backups of your work. <strong>Use the submit server as a backup
			tool by submitting often.</strong>
	</p>

	<div class="h4 myUnderline">Piazza</div>
	<p>
		We will be using (<a href="piazza.shtml">Piazza</a>) for class
		communication. You will not be able to register to Piazza yourself.
		Your instructor will register you using the email address
		you have in the school system. <strong>Posting of any kind of code in Piazza is not allowed.</strong>
	</p>

	<div class="h4 myUnderline">Class Announcements</div>
	<p>
		You are responsible for checking announcements we
		post in the <strong>announcements</strong> Piazza folder.
	</p>

	<div class="h4 myUnderline">Excused Absence and Academic Accommodations</div>
	<p>
		See the section titled "Attendance and Missed Assignments"
		available at <a href="http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html">Course Related Policies</a>.
	</p>

	<div class="h4 myUnderline">Accessibility</div>
	<p>
		See the section titled "Accessibility" available at
		<a href="http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html">Course
			Related Policies</a>.
	</p>

	<div class="h4 myUnderline">Academic Integrity</div>
	<p><strong>Please read this information carefully. We take academic integrity
			matters seriously.</strong>
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Academic dishonesty includes not only cheating, fabrication,
			and plagiarism, but also includes helping other students commit acts of
			academic dishonesty by allowing them to obtain copies of your work. All
			submitted work must be your own. Cases of academic dishonesty
			will be pursued to the fullest extent possible as stipulated by the
			<a href="https://www.studentconduct.umd.edu/">Office of Student Conduct</a>.
		</li>

		<li><strong>Situations that often lead to academic integrity violations:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>A student's friend/roommate shares an assignment's code. Once you provide
					your code to another student, you are a facilitator, even if you indicate to the student "not to copy-paste" any of it. <strong>Actually we had a case in which a student CS degree was revoked for this reason.</strong>
				</li>
				<li>Students use online resources (github, Chegg, etc.) to find assignments' solutions.
					The solutions are found by several students and all will be involved in an
					academic case.
				</li>
				<li>Students assume we don't have tools that check for similarities among all students' submissions.
				</li>
				<li>Students get desperate and don't want a 0 in the assignment.
				</li>
				<li>Students are not aware of the expectations regarding academic integrity.
				</li>
				<li>Students assume we don't take academic integrity matters seriously.</li>
				<li>You should only receive assistance from instructors/TAs. We have seen cases
					in which the use of tutors have led to academic integrity violations (e.g., tutors
					looked for assignment's solutions online).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li><strong>
				The Office of Student Conduct is responsible for handling academic integrity matters. After a report is submitted by an instructor, the case is evaluated by the office and it could result in an XF grade, degree revocation, or dismissal from the university.
			</strong>
		</li>

		<li>
			One of the most negative consequences of academic integrity violations is the emotional burden an academic integrity case has on a student. We have seen students extremely distraught as a result of an academic integrity violation. In many cases students chances for recommendations, TA positions, and other opportunities are negatively affected.
		</li>
		<li>Please read the section titled "Academic Integrity" available at
			<a href="http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html">Course Related Policies</a>
			and the information available at
			<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/resources/academicIntegrity.html"> Academic Integrity</a>
