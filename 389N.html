We will be devloping applications using a micro-service architecture pattern and discussing throughout the evolution of web application architectures and current trends.

   <p>
Once we have graded any class material (e.g., exams, projects, etc.)
we will post an announcement and a deadline by which you must submit
any regrade request (if necessary).  <strong>It is your responsibility
to submit regrade requests by the specified deadline; no regrade
requests will be processed afterwards.</strong>
   </p>


<div class="h4">Projects</div>
   <ul>
       <li><strong>Deadlines</strong> -
    All projects are due at <strong>8 pm</strong> on the specified day
    in the project description.  You have until <strong>8 pm</strong> of
    the next day to submit your project with a <strong>12%</strong>
penalty.  Notice that after the late period, you will not receive
any points for your project, even though you still need to satisfy
the good faith attempt (see information below).  <strong>For example,
if a project is due on Wednesday at 8 pm, you have until Thursday
at 8 pm to submit a late project with a 12% penalty.  Any submission
after Thursday 8 pm will receive 0 pts. </strong>
       </li>

       <li><strong>Project Submission</strong> -
    We will be using Gitlab to distribute course material to you as well as receive your project submissions. Upon completing any assignment and pushing to your repo, please login to <a href="https://gitlab.cs.umd.edu">the university gitlab server</a> and navigate to your course repo and verify that your changes are there.
       </li>

       <li><strong>Which Project Gets Graded</strong> -
          Your grade for an project will be based on the submission with
the highest score after the late penalty (if any) has been applied.
       </li>

       <li><strong>Good Faith Attempt</strong> -
    You must satisfy a minimum set of requirements for each project
    (Good Faith Attempt) otherwise you will not pass the course (automatic
    grade of F). Each project defines its own good faith attempt
    criteria and a deadline to provide an implementation that satisfies
it.  If you start a project on time, and look for assistance
(if required) you should have no problems satisfying the Good Faith
Attempt.  The Good Faith Attempt guarantees you have the skills
necessary for upper-level courses. <strong>Notice that you will not
receive extra points for completing the good faith attempt. The
grade you obtain for a project will be based on your ontime/late
submission. </strong>
       </li>

       <li><strong>Closed Projects</strong> -
    All programming assignments in this course are to be written
individually (unless explicitly indicated otherwise).  Cooperation
between students is a violation of the Code of Academic Integrity.
      </li>
   </ul>


<div class="h4">Regarding Posting of Project Implementations</div>
   <ul>
      <li>
         Do not post your assignments' implementation online (e.g.,
GitHub, PasteBin) where they can be seen by others.  Making your
code accessible to others can lead to academic integrity violations.
      </li>

      <li>
   Posting of your projects in a private repository where only selected
people (e.g., potential employers) can see them is OK. Just make
sure is not a public site. Your course repo is not a public site.
      </li>

<li>
   Even if the course is over, do not make your code publicly available
   to others.
</li>

      <li>We constantly monitor online sources.</li>
   </ul>


<div class="h4">TA Room/Office Hours</div>
<p>
Office hours get extremely busy the day before a project deadline.
Therefore do not wait to start your projects.  Regarding office
hours and the TA Room:
</p>
   <ul>
<li>
    Once you have been helped by a TA please leave the TA room.  We
    have a large number of students in all of our classes and the TA
          room is really crowded.
      </li>

<li>
    If there is a line of students waiting, a TA should spent at most
          5 minutes with a student.  Please remind TAs about this rule.
      </li>
</ul>

<div class="h4">Piazza</div>
<p>
We will be using (<a href="piazza.shtml">Piazza</a>) for class
communication.  You will not be able to register to Piazza yourself.
Your instructor will register you using the e-mail you have in the school
system.
</p>


<div class="h4">Excused Absence and Academic Accommodations</div>
<p>
See the section titled "Attendance, Absences, or Missed Assignments"
available at <a href="http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html">Course Related Policies</a>.
   </p>



<div class="h4">Disability Support Accommodations</div>
<p>
See the section titled "Accessibility" available at
<a href="http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html">Course
Related Policies</a>.
</p>



<div class="h4">Academic Integrity</div>
<p>
 Note that academic dishonesty includes not only cheating, fabrication,
 and plagiarism, but also includes helping other students commit acts of
 academic dishonesty by allowing them to obtain copies of your work. In
 short, all submitted work must be your own.  Cases of academic dishonesty
 will be pursued to the fullest extent possible as stipulated by the
 <a href="https://www.studentconduct.umd.edu/">Office of Student Conduct</a>.
   </p>

<p>
 It is very important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating,
 fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on
 the Code of Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please
 visit <a href="http://www.shc.umd.edu">http://www.shc.umd.edu</a>.
</p>

<p>
 The CS Department takes academic integrity seriously.  Information on how
 the CS Department views and handle academic integrity matters can be
 found at <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/resources/academicIntegrity.html"> Academic Integrity.</a>
</p>

<p>
       The following are examples of academic integrity violations:
   </p>
<ul>
<li>
   Hardcoding of results in a project assignment.  Hardcoding
refers to attempting to make a program appear as if it works
correctly (e.g., printing expected results for a test).
</li>

<li>
Using any code available on the internet/web or any other
source.  For example, using code from Sourceforge.
</li>

<li>
Hiring any online service to complete an assignment for you.
</li>

<li>
Sharing your code or your student tests with any student.
</li>

<li>
     Using online forums (other than our Slack group or our Piazza account) in order to ask for
help regarding our assignments.
      </li>
</ul>

<p>

"Academic Integrity" and "Code of Student Conduct" available at
